## There's 3 type of bot
- Event-based (Webhook)
- Scheduled (Normal Cron)
- Planned (Advanced Bot, like wishing your birthday at certain time)

all of them have individuals table, and report too. So each time it fired, a report generated for them to details what the log says (on database or a file).

I know that Scheduled and Planned name are ambigious, i'll find a new name soon, but for now, let me make a detailed progress on it too.
