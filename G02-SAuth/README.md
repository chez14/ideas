# SAuth
Stands for **Scan for Authenticate**, a new protocol just like OAuth.

I intended to make a new login option that are secure and fast and giving a clear detail what data that you chare to the app. This are a whole new portal with disctinctive easy-and-secure login option.

This idea are coming from LINE that providing other login option besides email and phone number.

This idea can extends to create a new option for payment. This idea has been implemented by [Zapper](https://zapper.com/) tho, but i'm sure if we could make this, you might charge it with cheaper price for merchant.

Benefits:

- User Friendly login
- Secure and Easy to use
- Use own barcode style
- Adjustable how to charge the merchant (you'd better charge the merchant than charge the customer.)

Note:

- in my ideas, you'll implement it on multiplatforms, even on Desktop PC too, and providing OAuth authentication too. So it's like, login once, tap afterward.
- use websocket for providing a refreshable login token.


I'll make more note in the future to describe this idea clearly.
