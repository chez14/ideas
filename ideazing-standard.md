## Folder naming standard

Some ideas are for general purpose, some don't. So there's a specific meaning behind those `p` and `g` names, here's the list:

| Prefix | Detail                                        |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| P      | Research (Penelitian), Specific Project       |
| G      | General Purpose                               |
| RS     | Research for Study (Intended for skripsi stuffs) |

Cheers,

Chris!
